   # Windows Activator 
<h3>An improved version and an oem version that is used to activate computers ðŸ’»</h3>

<h4>The Differences between the old one and this:</h4>
- It's updated to run virtually, without downloading any scripts involve.
<br> - It's free from any virus.
<br> - Lifetime activation guaranteed, using the HWID method.
<br> - Aesthetic changes in the UI.
<br> - Could activate Office as well. (beta phase.)
<h3> Next release will feature a Windows WMI. (basically a version of neofetch for checking the os and the system info) </h3>
